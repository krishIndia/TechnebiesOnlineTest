This is the basic test to make you learn how the test goes works.

In this a Linked list is created and 5 nodes are inserted into with values from 1 to 5.

The NodeListMain class prints the nodes first and then search for each value in the node.
However, as you can see in the results, the search is not working properly:
#####################################################################
NodeListMain: printing nodes 1-5
Print: 5
Print: 4
Print: 3
Print: 2
Print: 1

NodeListMain: trying to find values 1-5 in original
-> found '5'
-> did *NOT* find '4'
-> did *NOT* find '3'
-> did *NOT* find '2'
-> did *NOT* find '1'
#####################################################################

Your job is to identify the issue and solve it. Such that all the nodes are found properly.
