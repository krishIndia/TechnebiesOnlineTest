Crossword puzzle

Crossword puzzle is a simple Java Program for which you will be given 35 minutes in the actual test.
In this, we need to implement the logic behind the crossword and we should not worry about the displaying part.

Crossword is a simple puzzle we used to receive in the newspapers.
For the definition:
-> [   ] Defines a square in the whole puzzle.
-> [XXX] Defines a black square where nothing is allowed to be written.
-> [1  ] Here, 1 is the clue index. A number is assigned to a square if can be a start of a 2 letter word either horizontally or vertically.
-> The numbering is continuous and traverse Row wise.
-> [25D][  U], Here 'D' and 'U' are the values that are set to the squares.

This is the desired output of the TestCrossword
---------------------------------------------
[1  ][2  ][3  ][4  ][   ][XXX][5  ][6  ][   ]
[7  ][   ][   ][   ][XXX][8  ][   ][   ][XXX]
[9  ][   ][   ][XXX][10 ][   ][   ][XXX][11 ]
[12 ][   ][XXX][13 ][   ][   ][   ][14 ][   ]
[   ][XXX][15 ][   ][   ][   ][   ][   ][   ]
[16 ][17 ][   ][   ][   ][XXX][18 ][   ][   ]
[19 ][   ][   ][XXX][20 ][21 ][   ][   ][   ]
[22 ][   ][   ][23 ][   ][   ][   ][   ][   ]
[24 ][   ][   ][   ][XXX][25D][  U][  K][  E]

Your JOB is to implement the CrosswordImpl class. 
The methods are arranged in the order of the complexity. So you can implement the methods from top.
You can also add new classes if you want to. 

Suggestion :::
- Clue index is assigned to a box from where a word (row or column wise) can be formed.
e.g. 
1 is assigned to 0,0 because a word can be formed both row and column wise.
7 is assigned because a word can be formed only row wise. (Column wisse not possible as word from 7 will be part of word formed from 1.)
16 is assigned because a word can be formed row wise from here.
17 is assigned because a word is formed column wise from here.
