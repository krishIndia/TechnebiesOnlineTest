Currently the output of the LaserTest is as follows:

#############################

On every call to lineTo method, the bean is turning on and turning off. 
Your job is to make sure that the bean is not turned on and off everytime lineTo method is called.
The desired output of the test should be:

#############################

Move To :[10,20]
Move To :[20,20]
Move To :[20,10]

- Laser should be on while drawing a line to a location.
- Laser should be off while moving to a location.
- Reset should turn off the laser in case already on.
